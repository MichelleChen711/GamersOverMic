Description

Gamers connect with each other in temporary sessions of gameplay, after which you never see or hear of 
them again (most of the time). Conventional ways of voice chat makes the user download or sign up for 
their service. There is also no reason to add someone to your friends list who you will never talk to again.

This web based solution is an easy to use browser to browser communication site. Users can open the site 
and then create their own private temporary rooms. As long as the browser window of the private room is open, 
users will be able to voice chat/text/webcam with each other.

Future features will include a sign up and registration, changing this site into a social media solution for 
gamers. Registered users will be able to keep track of the last users they've made contact with in case they
want to get in touch with them again. They will also be able to add people to friends list and join their 
friends rooms.

Note: under time constraints and sole purpose of creating a working demo, the sourcecode is not very presentable, 
but nevertheless, I wish to showcase the project I helped create.
